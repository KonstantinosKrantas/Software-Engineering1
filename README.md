# Software-Engineering1

During the course of Software Engineering 1 we came up with an idea about an app which was a system to influence decisions using bots all around the web.
Regarding the 1st Deliverable, after a long process, we defined the requirements of the app (FR, NFR), created our uses stories and transformed them into gherkin.
Also we designed the interface of the app
and completed the modeling part using UML. 
For the 2nd Deliverable, we demonstrated the Design Patterns which will be used,
defined our resources and our REST interface using SwaggerHub.
Finally, we used Node-RED to run our users stories
